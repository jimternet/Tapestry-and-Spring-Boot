# Tapestry-and-Spring-Boot

This project is merely to see how to make Tapestry work with Spring boot
## Notes
 * it uses jar packaging
 * it still uses the src/main/webapp
 * it does NOT use the web.xml
## TODO
* figure out how to move src/main/webapp to resources or something to be more 'like' what boot is expecting
* integrate tapestry and boot properties.
* determine if appmodule/config can be replaced with beans
